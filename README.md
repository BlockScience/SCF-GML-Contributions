## Purpose:
This repo is aimed at facilitating multi-party collaboration on developing implementable Governance Modules (GMs). 
A formalized process helps to streamline such development, where if succesfull, the process results in new GMs being included in the Governance Modules Library (GML).  
While the GML is started as a Stellar community effort, the proposed workflow is reasonably agnostic, allowing discussion and cooperation across communities. 
Similarly, this allows for easier adoption of mechanisms researched or implemented elsewhere.

## What is a GM:
A GM is a living document of a governance concept, from ideation to a sample implementation, which allows it to be included in the Governance Modules Library. A GM is a Markdown file, that lives in the GM repository, with pre-defined sections. GM authors must adhere to the general structure to facilitate browsing and collaborative development of new GMs. 

## What is the GML:
The Governance Modules Library (GML) is a living collection of completed GMs. It is the final stage for GMs that are ready to be implemented on-chain or elsewhere. The GML only lists those GMs that are specified well enough to be implemented, while this repo facilitates the process towards that specificity.  

## Before Submitting:
1. Check whether your idea is already captured in a GM.
2. Check the [Desire_template](https://github.com/BlockScience/SCF-GML-Contributions/blob/main/Templates/Desire_template.md) and make sure you can describe the GM as needed. 

## How to become a Maintainer: 
The GML and its contribution pipeline are planned to be a community effort. If you would like to contribute, do XXX (Check -> post on discussion? Send msg to X?)
Maintenance of this repo includes moving items through backlogs by verifying that enough information has been given as per the current status. Additionally, discussions and forms need to be monitored to allow community members unfamiliar with PR processes to contribute.

There is no Copyright setup for this GM yet, this is to be added/considered soon.
